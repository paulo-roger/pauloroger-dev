Writing is somewhat hard for me, at least writing something that others are capable of reading, on top of that english isn't even my first language, so I am probably doing so many mistakes. But well, as everything in life you get to practice and read the error codes, or something like that. :)

I think this blog will be a good exercise, I was inspired by other developers and geeks that also keep their blogs, and I would like to mention and thank [Sky Leite](https://leite.dev/) for presenting me [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/). And of course her blog simple design inspired me. As I told her, it is so nostalgic to me at least, looks like those old internet pages simple but also elegant in a way.  I am such a nostalgic... Now I am looking up [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/) for a IRC client, do you remember IRC? what about ICQ or maybe the youngsters will remember MSN Messenger?

The internet in the 90s and early 2000s was such a magical place for me as a kid, discovering new sites (without google back then), the term web surfing used to make sense, now we are 100% of time connected we don't even value this anymore. I remember the very first site I accessed when I had my first PC at home, it was [www.queenonline.com](https://www.queenonline.com/) using MSN browser (yeah I was such an audacious newbie) and I was in awe as I looked at the pictures of Brian May playing the guitar and Freddie with arms open in 'V'. If I knew how to download those pictures back in the day...
You know what, I just got an idea!

I am going to re-live that moment, I should have thought of this before, I am going to use [waybackmachine](https://archive.org/web/) and refresh my memory of that day. If there is some therapeutical aspect to writing I don't know, but at the very least it helps to bring some ideas lol.

Again on the topic regarding the blog and writing, I had else another inspiration. Yesterday I found this folder with some backups of old bookmarks I had, and there it was [Aaron's blog](http://www.aaronsw.com/), may he rest in peace. Aaron is a big inspiration for me not only because of his work but because of the person he was. I strongly recommend for ~~every developer~~ **everyone** out there to read about him and watch the documentary of his life. He was such a brilliant person with a gigantic heart.

There is something valuable about the writing habit, I am realizing. I think it helps to organize my thoughts. I read some years ago that great personalities as in genius artists and thinkers used to walk around with a small notebook. In the moleskine page they mention "Vincent Van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway and Bruce Chatwin." I mean, I doubt they would buy a moleskine that costs over 5 times the price of a regular notebook. But maybe writing is some kind of secret those great minds had? I wonder what they used to write in their notebooks: Crazy ideas, thoughts, maybe secrets.

Ultimately, I think I have enough for a first post.

Peace!
