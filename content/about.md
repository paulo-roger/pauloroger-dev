Hi! I am Paulo, a mechanical engineer who fell in love with coding during college and never stopped to pursue this hobby until it became my life and now my job too.

I've played a lot with VBA and Excel, some C coding in college, then learned my way through javascript and nowadays I am exploring Sales Force Commerce Cloud development, trying to improve everyday. But besides code languages I love playing with algorithms and math.

On my spare time I'm a forever Dungeon Master™ and I love to come up with new RPG rules systems and ~~debatable~~ improvements to D&D 5e. Also I love to write stories and invent worlds for my players to dwell in. I believe this kind of hobby is relaxing and very welcome in the current world we live in...

Another hobby I have is music, and I can't help but quote Nietzsche "without music life is a mistake". I know it is a cliché but still it is powerful and true. Anyway, when I am not writing my own songs I like to play some Running Wild, Savatage, Iron Maiden, you know the drill.

<3 Married with the best wife I could ever dream and father to two little pomeranians (Arien and Yuki).
